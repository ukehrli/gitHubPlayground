git diff HEAD       //View difference between HEAD and Working Directory
git diff <masterbranch_path> <remotebranch_path>

Explain:
                      HEAD (The pointer)
  get diff c3 c4      master
c1 -- c2 --c3 -- c4 -- c5 (local git)
     git diff --cached c5 --> diff to stage(Index)
         git diff HEAD c5 --> diff to Working Directory

Example diff branchs (local /remote):
# ------ What are my local branches and how they mapped to remote branches (The active shows a star)
git branch --list -vv
git remote show origin

# ------ With that branch info do:
git diff master origin/master
